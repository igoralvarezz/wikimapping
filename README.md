# wikimapping
Wikimapping is a simple python webscrapping script (using URLlib and BeautifulSoup 4 among other libraries) to get all the countries mentioned in any given Wikipedia article and display them in an HTML page with an interactive svg map (draw using topojson and D3.js JavaScript libraries) and tabular information. Once scrapped, it stores all the article's information locally using an SQLite database to avoid multiple callings to Wikipedia.

This is my capstone project for the [Python For Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python).
