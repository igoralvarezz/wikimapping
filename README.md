Python webscrap script to get all the countries mentioned in a given Wikipedia article and display them in an HTML page with an interactive svg map (draw using topojson and D3.js JavaScript libraries) and tabular information.

This is my capstone project for the [Python For Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python).
